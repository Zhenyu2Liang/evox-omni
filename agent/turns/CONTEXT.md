# agent/turns — ordered public presentation

## Intent

This node projects original Pi events into an ordered public transcript. It does not
classify user intent from words, rewrite model archives, authorize a banking action,
or derive execution evidence from prose. The typed turn declaration updates the
buffer's advice and protocol-example preferences through the runtime callback.
This node is presentation only: it implements no banking tools and no card tooling or card-consumption/spend/purchase/pay/debit capability (card and account tools live in `../tools/`).

## Ownership

- `buffer.current` owns the current assistant prose only. Complete prose remains
  verbatim, subject to whole-protocol format validation and bounded model repair.
- `buffer.assistants` is the ordered list of new presentation messages, including
  independent `role: tool` entries. Its historical name does not restrict message roles.
- Each tool entry has empty content, one tool event, and only its own result or
  authorization cards. `ToolEventView.messageId` identifies that entry. Provider call
  IDs alone cannot identify an owner because different responses may reuse them.
- Production IDs combine the durable run and model-request identities; a tool ID
  also includes its original call ID. Pure non-journal adapters use a redacted
  provider-message fingerprint as a fallback. A recovered original response retains
  its presentation IDs even when timestamps or call IDs are repeated.
- `toolMessages` tracks active calls within the current model response. Starting a
  later assistant clears this active lookup, while ordered transcript entries remain.

## Events

`events.ts` emits message start, tool start/update/end, owned cards, and a complete
tool-message end snapshot. Tool completion republishes its own entry even when
presentation fails. Normal model text never accumulates tool cards or diagnostics.
The internal `describe_turn` tool stays in the Pi journal but creates no public row,
business card, or financial fact.

`readyPresentationEvents()` publishes completed prose in its original position and
withholds unfinished candidates. Tool progress and owned business cards can publish
while the next response is being generated. `card.messageId` and `plan_update.messageId`
bind their exact owners rather than selecting the latest assistant.

`authorization-view.ts` binds a plan and its parked authorization to the original
submit-plan entry. Authorization resume updates the original action/call entry and
adds its verified result card there; a later assistant remains independent.

## History and recovery

`../transcript-activity.ts` reconciles scoped invocation and authorization evidence.
Model-request identity disambiguates reused call IDs within one run. It does not
attach execution results to an unrelated narration. `../transcript-presentation.ts`
normalizes existing mixed UI entries without changing original prose or the model
archive; an ambiguous historical card remains a separate system entry.

Durable continuation restores completed presentations from original recorded model
groups and results. This restoration emits UI events only, without rerunning a
banking tool. Current model replay and the raw event journal retain their own evidence.

## Verification

Pure coverage: `tests/unit/planner/tool-timeline.test.ts`,
`tests/unit/planner/transcript-activity.test.ts`, and `tests/unit/planner/tool-feedback.test.ts`. The timeline suite checks
same-name calls, reverse completion order, exact action ownership, stable recovered
IDs, complete before/after prose, internal-tool isolation, presentation failure, and
withholding unfinished candidates. Run with `VITEST_SKIP_DB_SETUP=1` to avoid database
generation and provisioning.
